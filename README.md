## Background

This software is in a **very** alpha stage and is not meant to be used in production yet.

### Who are we ?

The Distributed Gallery is a collective of thinkers and tinkers engaged in a critical approach toward art markets and artistic worlds.

Disturbed by the overinterpretation of artistic intentions, the Distributed Gallery defends a more sensitive and authentic approach of the so-called contemporary art. Moreover, it wishes to replace in the center of the game the collective anonymous work in which the figure of the artist evaporates.

Born from a poker-like joke, the Distributed Gallery intends to continue experimentations and open the gallery to Blockchain’s possibilities, a framework in which all the rules are redefinable at will.
